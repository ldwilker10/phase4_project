## Modeling 

Baseline Model: The initial baseline model was a simple neural network model with ____


Convolutional Neural Network Model:


## Best Model Results 

After tuning both the baseline model and initiating a cnn model, the tuned ___ model had the best performance based our specific metrics of focus:

- Choose metrics of focus
- F1 Score, Recall score, accuracy 

With the Best Model ____

| Metric                  | Baseline                          | CNN Model                         |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Train Score             | 0.                                | 0.                                |
| Test Score              | 0.                                | 0.                                |
| Accuracy Score          | 0.                                | 0.                                |
| Precision Score         | 0.                                | 0.                                |
| F1 Score                | 0.                                | 0.                                |
| Recall Score            | 0.                                | 0.                                |
| Cross Validation Scores | 0.868, 0.903, 0.898, 0.898, 0.906 | 0.868, 0.906, 0.902, 0.901, 0.903 |


### Regarding the Best Model Scores:

Accuracy: 

Recall: The model's overall recall score was 0.833 which means that out of all of the individuals/patients that actually had pneumonia, the model correctly identified __% of those. 

Precision: The model's overall precision score was ___ which indicates that out of all the times that the model labeled an individual with pneumonia(predicted positives), 45.1 % of those actually had pneumonia (true positives)

F1 Score: The model's overall score was __ which takes into account both of precision and recall. Generally if this value is higher, this indicated the model is doing well all around.

## Conclusion/ Recommendations 



Recommendations: 

- Healthcare providers should utilize this model as a tool for early pneumonia detection. While this model is not an official diagnostic tool for penuamonia, this model is useful for early detecton and screening. 

- Using this model, practitioner's can implement preventative health strategies to their patient population early on before disease progression and improve overall health outcomes. 

- In the context of identifying pneumonia.
